	<h2>About this Website</h2>

	<p>At first it may seem as some of the most ordinary restaurant websites, but actually the development of this website was the part of "HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for Web Development" online course by Johns Hopkins University. Eventually, I've completed the course and this is the final result. On this page, I'd like to introduce myself and share with some of my previous experience.</p>

			<p>I'm Zhomart Zhetpisbekov, 19 y.o. software engineer, who just started his journey. Currently, I live in Almaty, Kazakhstan and study at <a href="https://iitu.edu.kz/en/">IITU (International Information Technology University)</a></p>
			<p>I was used to learning a bit of Back-End Development and IOS Development in past, however, for now, I've decided to focus on Front-End Development, so that I'll be capable of developing the whole website on my own.</p>
			<p>This website was totally developed by me following the course. Despite the fact that it was my first time creating the functional website and it was unsurprisingly hard, I guess I've done a great job.</p>
			<p>Make sure to follow me on social networks, so that we can keep in touch!</p>
